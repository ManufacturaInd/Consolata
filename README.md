## What is this?

A proportional variation of Inconsolata, a great monospace font designed by Raph Levien. The spacing was cloned from Lato, a proportional Sans Serif font by Lukasz Dziedzic.

The operation occurred on Saturday May 25 2013 in Porto, in the frame of the LGRU (Libre Graphics Research Unit) meeting, and was performed by Ricardo Lafuente (Manufactura Independente), on the request of Manuel Schmalstieg (Greyscale Press), using the Tiny Type Tools.

## Tiny Type Tools ?

The Tiny Type Tools are a set of (Python) scripts for FontForge, designed to aid your type design workflow. 

You can find them in the tiny type tools repository: https://gitorious.org/+manufactura-independente/manufacturaindhacks/tinytypetools

They are made available under the GNU General Public License Version 3.

## But where are the source files of the font?

Ricardo likes to work directly on the TTF files (wich FontForge can edit and save). Therefore the TTF files are both the source and the production format.
